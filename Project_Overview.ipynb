        "Description of Project: We are looking to create a create an accurate and effective spam detection system in order to look through both SMS text messages and Emails to ascertain if the message is spam and can be filtered out of the user's inbox. Spam messages have become more sophisiticated and aim to bypass modern spam filters, and we want to target all sorts of spam in our system. This is applicable to many people across the world and serves to improve quality of life, reduce risk of financial scams, and prevention of malware.\n",
        "\n",
        "We want to use 4+ datasets - one for each normal emails / sms, and one for each spam emails / sms. We want to incorporat various NLP tchniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, and logistic regressions / neural networks for characterization anad learning. We will use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 in order to best decide if the message is spam.\n",
        "\n",
        "A lot of these topics were touched upon in the lectures and in class, and we want to use a lot of similar approches from the homework to apply here.\n",
